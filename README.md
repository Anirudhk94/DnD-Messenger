[Demo] Building a new feature for chat rooms.  

This project is built to demo a new gesture, i.e, "onDoubleTap" to forward a message in the current chat window without any hassle.

Since, majority of chatting applications (like messenger, whatsapp), already have single tap gesture, force touch gesture assigned to 
various operations like copying, selecting, replyting etc, I chose double tap as my gesture to implement the feature.

This project is an attempt to showcase the power of this feature.

WORKING 

I'll explain this feature using 4 steps - 
Let us assume, there are two users, John and Sara. 

Step 1 - John logs into his chatting application and navigates to Sara's chat window.

Step 2 - The resulting window has all the messages that were exchanged between John and Sara.

Step 3 - Now, let us say the most reacent message that Sara has sent John is "Hey".

Step 4 - On double tapping this message, the input field in John's chat window is filled with the exact same message - "Hey".
